# Screensaver Art
is a simple HTML project that can be used as a screensaver. When viewed as a screensaver, lines go across the screen slowly forming a colorful piece of art. The raw code is saved in the HTML file. It is also available on my Netlify page.
# Webpage
Screensaver Art is viewable from https://scr-art.netlify.app
# How to use
You can combine this project with the Chromium web saver (found [here](https://github.com/ZenProjects/Chromium-Web-Page-Screensaver)) to use this as your computer's screensaver. Just add scr-art.netlify.app to the list of webpages to view and set the time per page to 300 seconds.
